# Space Quiz App

A simple Android Space Quiz Application. 

A project which allows a user to enter their name and answer a series of five challenging questions on the topic of space.
Each question opens up in a new screen using intents, and questions have answers that can be input through the use of Radio Buttons, Checkboxes and Text Input. 
The user can track their score throughout the quiz and / or see their total score at the end of the quiz. They are also presented with the option to email their score to a friend using intents. 

The space icon images used in the app were licensed from Creative Market and edited for this project, so please do not use these resources in anything without licensing them yourself.
